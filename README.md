# Instagram Reels Auto-Scroller & PiP Player 🚀

A powerful JavaScript snippet to supercharge your Instagram Reels experience on Desktop. It enables **auto-scrolling**, a clean **Picture-in-Picture (PiP)** mode, and background playback without pausing.

## ✨ Features

- **Auto-Advance**: Automatically scrolls to the next Reel when the current one ends.
- **Picture-in-Picture Mode**:
  - Pops the video out into a clean, floating window.
  - **Clutter-Free**: Hides all Instagram UI (comments, likes, sidebars) for a pure video experience.
  - **Mobile Aspect Ratio**: Forces a vertical layout perfect for Reels.
- **Background Playback**: Includes "Focus Spoofing" to prevent videos from pausing when you switch tabs or minimize the window.
- **Quick Controls**:
  - **Giant Skip Button**: A custom "SKIP ⏭️" button in the PiP window to jump to the next video instantly.
  - **Restore View**: A placeholder in the main window lets you easily return the video to the original tab.

## 🛠️ How to Use

1.  Open [Instagram Reels](https://www.instagram.com/reels/).
2.  Open your browser's **Developer Console** (`F12` or `Right Click -> Inspect -> Console`).
3.  Copy the code from `autoscroll.js`.
4.  Paste it into the console and hit **Enter**.
5.  Enjoy! The player will pop out automatically.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

-   **Video Pauses in Background?** The script has built-in anti-pause logic, but some browsers are aggressive. Try keeping the window visible on a second monitor if possible.
-   **Skip Button Not Working?** Click it again; sometimes the browser needs a moment to catch focus.
